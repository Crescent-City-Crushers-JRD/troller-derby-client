            <h1>WELCOME TO TROLLER DERBY</h1>
            <h2>What is Troller Derby?</h2>
            <p>TROLLer Derby is a variation of flat track roller derby in which fans pay to change the rules (trolling
                the skaters and officials!) Trolls differ from Troller Derby to Troller Derby, invented by the Teams and
                reviewed and approved by the Coaches and Staff. Favorites include things like swapping jammers with referees,
                replacing blockers with giant inflatable pool toys, changing the scores, or making jammers dance to score.
            </p>
            <p>Our "Trolls" are divided into three categories: Friendship, Laughs, and Advantages.</p>
            <p><span>Friendship Trolls</span> are kindly donations to our Troller Derby and the teams participating, Friendship Troll
            donations will be announced with the Jam and displayed during the game.</p>
            <p><span>Laugh Trolls</span> are funny effects that are generally hilarious. They can affect everyone or be applied
            to one team. You can buy them at any time and they will happen during gameplay or for a specific jam</p>
            <p><span>Advantage Trolls</span> are applied to only one team, you choose. These are trolls typically improve (or worsen)
            the rules, points, or game outcome for the team selected. You can buy them at any time and they will be used for one Jam.</p>
            <p>Troller Derby is a fun way to raise funds for our Derby League. All trolls purchased are tax-deductible donations.</p>
